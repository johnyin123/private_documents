In this configuration:

Replace <AS_number> with the Autonomous System (AS) number of your network.
Replace <neighbor_ip> with the IP address of the BGP neighbor.
Replace <neighbor_AS> with the AS number of the BGP neighbor.
Replace <ttl_value> with the Time-to-Live value if the BGP neighbor is more than one hop away.
Replace <source_interface> with the source interface for BGP sessions if needed.
Replace <number_of_paths> with the desired number of equal-cost paths to be used.
Replace <network_address> with the network address you want to advertise.
Replace <subnet_mask> with the subnet mask of the advertised network.
